### what is devops?
devops is main focuss on automation by steamlineing the software development process from design to implemenation, from code to testing and deployment by using the varies tools

### what is SRE ?
SRE  is mainly focuss on system reliability,monitoring and cost optimaization after the deployment

### what is cloud computing ?
cloud computing is like design, build and manage the infrasturcture on the cloud.

### Chaos engineering
intentionally introducing failures and unpredictable conditions to test how systems respond. The goal is to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities before they lead to real-world outages or service disruptions.
  --> improving the resilience and reliability of systems

  key : Steady State,System Behavior,Analyze Results,Minimize Blast Radius

  Common Chaos Engineering Practices: Fault Injection(server outages, network disruptions, or disk failures.),Latency Injection,Dependency Failures,Resource Exhaustion(like  CPU, memory, or disk resource limits)

  ### Subnets
  Subnets (short for subnetworks) are subdivisions of an IP network that help organize, manage, and secure network resources.
   1) Subnets allow you to break down a large network into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, a large IP range like 192.168.0.0/16 can be divided into multiple smaller subnets, such as 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.
   2) By dividing a network into smaller subnets, local traffic within a subnet stays isolated, reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic across the entire network.
